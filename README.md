# MNIST-GAN

This repository holds the code used to complete my final project for ITCS 5156 Applied Machine learning.

The goal was to train a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to generate hand written digits similar to those found in the MNIST dataset.

The majority of the code was obtained from following [this tutorial](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/dcgan_faces_tutorial.html).
